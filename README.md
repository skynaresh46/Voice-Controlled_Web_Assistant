This project is a browser-based Virtual Assistant built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Web Speech API to recognize voice commands and respond using speech synthesis. The assistant can listen, speak, and perform basic tasks such as opening websites, telling the current time and date, and responding to user queries.

This project demonstrates how frontend web technologies can be used to create an interactive, voice-controlled application without any backend or external libraries.
